# thoughts

## Styling options

- Add styling options, 
- Set background colour / image
- Set border style etc...

## custom keymap

- Should be able to change default keymapping

- should perhaps make a setup() function?

## implement push/pop-methods

- push and pop methods for structured interaction with the Call Stack
    - that's maybe not smart, as it will limit your flexability

- makes sure to only push and pop tasks from the top of stack.
- will also need ability to switch order of tasks
